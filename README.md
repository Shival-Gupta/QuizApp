# QuizApp
QuizApp, a Java and MySQL-based project created during my class 12 studies. It offers multiple operating modes (Timer mode, non-Timer mode) and includes login/signup functionality. Users can select topics, set the number of questions, and access the integrated leaderboard system. Developed with a focus on intuitive user experience and seamless functionality.
